## Navigation Moving and Line Management
You don't need to highlight a WHOLE line in VS Code to cut it (or copy it)
- it is enough to press `Ctrl + C` (or `Ctrl + X`)
- It works the same way in **IntelliJ**

## Code Navigation - Go To
- hold CTRL and when you click on something it will lead you to where it is defined
- same holds for Go To Definition and Peek Definition
- especially that it opens this inline browser, which you can even use to edit directly the content (not only to see "the related code")

## Search
- ‚≠ê use regex to search
  - use `ALT + ENTER` to select all occurences

In command-palette (shift+ctrl+p)
- `@` opens symbol browser (for that file)
  - Symbol Search is used for Function & Classes Names, rules, ...
- `@:` groups symbols into related segments (e.g., classes, methods, functions)
- `#` cross-search (across different files throughout the whole project, workspace)
- `:` to go directly to a specific line.
