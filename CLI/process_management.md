- `jobs` - which jobs are running
- `fg` - puts the program into the foreground | `bg` runs jobs in the background
- `service` - access daemons running in the background
- `kill` vs `pkill`
  - [Fkill-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/fkill-cli) - fabulously kill processes (fkill)
  - Tired of `ps -ef | grep <process>` and then `kill <PID>`? `fkill` kills processes by name, e.g. `fkill node`.
- `killall`
- `pstree` - show (active) processes in the form of a tree
Signals
- `<C-z>` puts the job in background
- `pdiof` command --- find the id of the process of a running app
- `pgrep` searches for a process by its name (similar to pdiof but does not require exact name)
  - and `pkill`
- `ps -ef` (e -all processes, f - descriptive)
- `top`
