[TS Project](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/project/project.html)
- Compilation Context - defined by tsconfig.json
    - *tsconfig.json* - read by tsc and code editors with TS support
- Declaration Spaces
    - variable and type declaration space
        - type declaration serves for the type annotation
            - class, interface, type Foo
- Modules
    - Namespaces & Modules
    - by default there is global namespace
    - If you include import/export at the beginning of the file it creates file modules namespace (basically this happens if there is only single import in your file)
        - instead of global namespace you need to explicitly import/export stuff
    - Type of generated modules is determined by the **compiler** flag module in tsconfig
        - External Modules [CommonJS, amd, ESM, others]
            - depending on the "module" compiler option you can generate different JS
                - ***NOTE***: sounds similar like Webpack config so check diff

    - Path Respolution
        - when the path is not relative: [node style resolution](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together) - What is this about?
        - in package.json: main vs type
            - main is the entry point for the package
