-  [Toolbox](./toolbox.md)
-  [dotfiles](dotfiles.md) as a solution to manage CLI settings and customizations
-  [CLI tools](./CLI/README.md)
   -  [Vim](./CLI/vim.md) subsection as well belong here
-  [VS Code](./code/README.md)
-  [Browsers](./browsers/README.md)
-  [IDE - IntelliJ Idea](./idea.md)

Similar to the approach in [VS Code](./code/README.md) section, define your expectations and requirements
- (general guideline) aim to install only what is really necessary! Use as much as possible VMs and Docker Containers
## Common VS Code and IntelliJ Settings:
- Theme: One Dark Pro
- Font: Fira Code
- Font Size: 15
- Atom Material Icons
- LF End-of-Line (EOL)
Synchronize settings in VS Code and IntelliJ: [Editorconfig File](https://editorconfig.org/)
- an Idea, create your own editorconfig file which you will place here (you can include settings like `theme` and `font` in comments, if they are not recognized by the editorconfig tool)
