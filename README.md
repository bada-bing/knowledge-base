# MISC
- Best Practice 1: in general you should discourage using root for any operations. Do not ssh to your remote server as root. Create dedicated user and disable root.
	- you should create user with more privileges and disable completely login with root
- Best Practice 2: change the port where your ssh-agent (ssh-server) is (by default it is 42)
	- since it is default, hackers try by default to log in using this port
		- by changing the port it gives you some small amount of increased security
