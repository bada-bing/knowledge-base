# ToC
* [Features](#features)
* [Customization](customize.md)
- [Shortcuts](./shortcuts.md) - should be dissolved into other files based on the features

What are my main Use-Cases:
1. Development
   * Testing
2. Writing Documentation

Requirements:
1. Speed
   1. Being Mouseless
2. Automatization
   1. Delegation of tasks to the tool (e.g., linting, formatting, text insertion)
   2. this is directly related to integration with other tools (e.g, linting tools, docker,...)
3. Nice UI

How to satisfy requirements:
1. Features
   - important Keybindings and Tips for the available Features
2. Customization (what would be relation between extensions and customization, and customization and shortcuts)
   1. Extensions (don't use what you don't need; don't be affraid to try new things)
   2. Settings & Keybindings

# Features
* [Navigation and Search](1_navigation_and_search.md)
* [Development](2_development.md)
* [Text Manipulation](3_text-manipulation.md)
- VS Codelens - They're interactions that allow context aware actions for portions of your code base.
* [Source-Control](4_source_control.md)
* [Linting](linting.md)
* [Automatization](#automatization)
* [Data Management](#data)

# Automatization
## Tasks
- what is especially useful is that you can capture output into "problems" and make them a clickable links
  - here is the link from slides [link](https://github.com/mike-works/vscode-fundamentals/blob/master/docs/2_customizing/tasks.md)
    - an example where this could be useful is if you run prettier and try to lint the code and to make as clickable links all the warnings and errors

# Data
- `Cosmos DB` extension to communicate to Mongo DB (Cosmos DB is related to Azure, but it can work for any Mongo DB)
