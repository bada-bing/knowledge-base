- market pricing determines the interest rates, auctioned by the market participants (by professionals who know what they're doing).

Typically by paper, people mean "security"
- a comercial security that is a debt instrument, basically an IOU ("Investor Owned Utilities")

- Political Problems are in general not solved with Economic tools, and vice versa
  - the example of Latin America and the often crisis there

Begin of the Lecture - Net Present Value II

- The Asset is a sequence of its cashflows
  - Small distinction, not the value of the asset but the asset itself is a sequence of its cashflows
  - we first need to define these exchange rates in order to define the value of the asset

- The example with the company which wants to install some kind of system for saving on electricity
  - with interest rate of 4% it is a good deal
  - if the interest rate would be 10% it would be not, it would be better to put the money in the bank and get the interest

- The objective of the company is to increase the value of its shareholders
- With proper valuation management decisions are clear

Two special cashflows which are very interesting for the class:
First of them is **Perpetuity** (a stream of cash payments that continues forever)
- in Great Kingdom there is a bond called Consol (not console), which is a perpetuity
- you can trade it, buy it, observe it, pay the price
$$PV = \frac{C}{r}$$


The second is **Annuity** - Pays Constant Cashflow C for T periods
- examples: bonds, auto loan, mortgage
- if you think in another way, annuity is just a perpetuity on borrowed time

$$PV = \frac{C}{r} - \frac{C}{r}\cdot\frac{1}{(1+r)^T}$$

There are tables which are called annuity discount factor

eg, if you buy the house... the amount you borrow (eg, 200k$) is the left side (ie PV), your monthly payment is C (cashflow) and the prevailing interest rate is r (annuity discount factor)

- almost all interest rates in the world are quoted on an annual basis
  - if you keep an investment for 12 months that is what the rate of return (for that investment) is going to be

Compounding (starts around 1h:08)
- pogledaj ovo opet
- in essence compounding means you get interest on your interest (and your interest's interest)

* APR - Annual Percentage Rate
* ERA - Equivalent Annual Rate (what you are really going to get)
  - can be considered as annual percentage yield
