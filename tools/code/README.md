In VS Code I covered most of the article ‚Ä¶ I came to code [formatting](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-tips-and-tricks#code-formatting)
- [customize](./code.customize.md)
- [shortcuts](./code.shortcuts.md)
- [linting](./code.linting.md.md)

# Tips
- CLI Commands:
  - ```code --diff <file1> <file2>``` - code's diff-checker editor
    - in GUI: in File Explorer -> right click on the file -> `select for compare` and `compare with selected`
    - or select 2 files and `compare selected`
  - ```code -r ``` opens the code in the last recently used environment

- Use `F8` to Cycle through Problems
  - You can filter problems by type ('errors', 'warnings') or text matching

- Fuzzy File Navigation (Ctrl + p) - Omnibox
  - `Ctrl + Enter` (instead of `Enter`) will open the File in the Side Window
  - switch between open side editors using (Ctrl + 1; Ctrl + 2)
    - editor is NOT a tab (editor is like pane in tmux)
  - In command-palette `:` to go directly to a specific line.
  - Symbol navigation: By adding "@:", you can activate Symbol Search (for that file).
    - Symbol Search is used for Function & Classes Names, rules, ...
  - Symbol navigation: By adding "#", you can activate Symbol Search throughout the whole project (workspace).
- F1 works in the same way as ctrl + shift + p (Opens Command Palette)

- In Settings you can create language associations for File Extensions that are not detected accurately (eg, many config files are in JSON):
```json
"file. associations" : {
 ".database" : "json"
 }
```

- [Preview Editors](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/vnext/release-notes/June_2016.md#preview-editors)
  - Files with *Tab Title written in Italics*
    - if open new file from this tab, the new opened file will overwrite the existing content of that tab
    - if you double-click on the tab name the file goes from Preview to Open Mode (the italics letter will become normal)
- VS Code uses Emmet
  - Emmet is inteligent enough to read data aobut the size of the image and to populate attributes width and height automatically
		- it is important to set this attributes in advance so that browser knows immediately how much space to reserve for the image
    - By using updateImageSize in command in VS Code, emmet can find the source of the image and automatically populate these attributes
- Workspace specific files are in .vscode. For example, tasks.json for the Task Runner and launch.json for the debugger.
- VS Codelens - They're interactions that allow context aware actions for portions of your code base.

- ‚¨á Both VS Code and Chrome DEV Tools have **Logpoints** (apart from Breakpoints and Conditional Breakpoints)
  - they behave like `console.log`, but they belong to the Editor itself and are never inserted into the source code.
  - they do NOT work if there is a syntax error, and therefore are NOT that useful.

## Navigation Moving and Line Management
You don't need to highlight a WHOLE line in VS Code to cut it (or copy it)
- it is enough to press `Ctrl + C` (or `Ctrl + X`)
- It works the same way in **IntelliJ**

## Search
- ‚≠ê use regex to search
  - use `ALT + ENTER` to select all occurences

- `@` opens symbol browser
- `@:` groups symbols into related segments (e.g., classes, methods, functions)
- `#` cross-search (across different files)

## Go To
- hold CTRL and when you click on something it will lead you to where it is defined
- same holds for Go To Definition and Peek Definition
- especially that it opens this inline browser, which you can even use to edit directly the content (not only to see "the related code")

Emmet is aware of the context you are in
- by default it will give you `div`, but if you are inside of `ul` it will give you `li` by default

some emmet abbreviations
! (and TAB) gives you basic HTML page template

sometimes if you write long expressions, emmet can get lost - in that cases you should press SPACE + ENTER to bring emmet back

‚≠ê Emmet has functionality `balance inward` & `balance outward`
  - it balances your selection (of code) to the closing tags (this is like in intellij IDEA when you press multiple times CTRL + W) - it expands your selection in a smart way
‚≠ê `Wrap with abbreviation` - this will wrap the selection with `emmet abbreviation` (e.g., `div`)
‚≠ê `Update Tag` - can be used to replace opening and closing tags, e.g., from div to selection
‚≠ê `Update Image Size` - you should always specify image size (so that browser knows how much space to reserve)
- emmet can do this for you

- think of it as using CSS Selectors for DOM generation
- emmet is a nice feature, aim to use it! (and don't be obsessed with productivity) like in regex... better to use many small emmet patterns than one which is big
  - also, vs code usually places cursors in right spots, so that helps as well
- üåüif I understood correctly when typing abreviations, you should not use spaces anywhere!
- "+" sibling selector `.navbar + .content + .footer`
- ">" direct descendant selector `ul > .list-items*5{Item $}`
  - it will create 5 li items with content "Item 1", ... $ represents index
  - it already knows that inside of ul children should be of type `li`

# Debugging
https://scotch.io/tutorials/debugging-javascript-in-google-chrome-and-visual-studio-code
https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/debugging-in-vscode.html
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/vuejs-cli

- debugging of node in VS Code is based on `node --inspect --inspect-brk ./index.js`
  - inspector is a new node debugging protocol (to enable different tools to communicate with node)
  - there are 2 options (launch to inspect new session or attach to inspect existing session)
  - Invest more in learning conditional breakpoints and other features (e.g, there is a hit-count, that is ... it will break (freeze)  only if that line is accessed that number of times)
  - Restart Frame is a good feature (you specify a stackframe (i.e., function) in the stack trace, and click "restart frame" and it will restart everything and stop at that point)
    - it can be helpful in situation where you need to make api calls or restart browser, it can help you there a lot, so research
  - skipping code (this feature exists in Chrome as well)
    - this is really helpful since you don't want to bother with native libraries and stop there at any point (e.g., Vue lib)
  - launch.json is the file in .vscode where you specify your debug configuration

- for launch configuration store your env variable into `.env` file and then specify the file in launch config using `envFile`

nodemon has also default configuration for debugging in VS Code
- it is available as one of default options when you setup `launch.json`

- there are compound configurations (to debug both backend and frontend at the same time) but do not find them that useful right now
    - if you feel the need at some point, invest more time into it, for now just skip it
    - in launch.json you would specify something like `"compounds": [...]`

## Type Checking
- use types wherever you can
- they help you to catch bugs at compile time! (this should highly increase maintainability of the project)
- and better dev experience (it provides better autocompletion and additionally serves a documentation)
  - some functions are less amigiuous when you add types
    - e.g., function add could mean something different if your parameters are of type number, or of type array
- TS files are automatically checked in VS Code
  - if you have **tsconfig.json** in your project, you can add `"checkJs":true` to also check JS files
  - otherwise, no matter which type of project is, you can add `// @ts-check` on top of the file to enable type checking for that file
- additionally, you can add types using comment annotations with JSDoc:
```javascript
/** @type{number} */
let value;
```

- VS Code uses structural type system (not nominal)
  - that means that it will induce the type based on the structure of the object (if it has properties relevant for that type) ... if it walks like a duck, and makes noise like a duck, it is a duck
  - nominal type system would mean that it will induce the type based on the name (I think that is how Java works)

# Dockerizing an Application
- we dockerize the application (e.g., express app) so that we can ship it and run it somewhere else
- First step which you need to do is to add configuration files
  - Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.debug.yml, and .dockerignore
  - Open COmmand Palette and run "Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace"
    - then select the app platform (e.g., node) and it will pull base image (from dockerhub) for that platform
  - Dockerfile is used to build the image, and if you want to build it, you will run `docker: build image`
    - check what does really build image means? is it building a container from image or building an image
  - for runnning containers you can attach to them using attach shell or you can view logs
- you can use VS Code to deploy to a docker registry (dockerhub)

- docker-compose.yml allows you to specify multiple images and link them together
  - e.g., enables our containerized app to talk to mongodb (which is also a container)

- docker-compose.debug.yml can be used to debug your app which is running inside of a container


for work with containers VS Code has remote-containers
- essentially this is about having the application running from the container, but being integrated with your VS Code
- it opens the project from the container (and also VS Code is part of that container, it will have all settings which are stored in .devcontainers configuration)
  - we can use that containerized VS Code (with the project) as our development environment
  - how this works is that VS Code sets up a little server in the container which communicates with our VS Code and they are able to share information
- configuration for this is in .devcontainers folder

# Git & Source-Control
## inline annotations to show differences from your local changes
- each new line which is changed, i.e., different from content commited in Repository will be marked with "some blue marker" next to the line number
- if the content is removed we see in a similar way the red triangle which denotes that something is removed
- if the content is added it will show green indicator
- the indicator in the bottom-bar next to the branch name is the sync-indicator (it does both pull and push, and that is the main difference to "just pull")
- in vscode is really simple to undo last commit
- in Source Control window just find option "undo last commit"

- similar like in SourceTree, you can also stage only chunks of a certain file
  - in GIT view select part of the file which you want to stage and right-click it
    - select "stage selected ranges" (there are options to revert and untrack)

Github has an official extension for working with Pull Requests in VS Code

# Data
Burke Holland uses Cosmos DB extension to communicate to Mongo DB (Cosmos DB is related to Azure, but it can work for any Mongo DB)


## Tasks
- what is the benefit of running tasks? convenience?
  - it looks like that you can run npm scripts as tasks
    - shift + ctrl + p > type "task"
- what is especially useful is that you can capture output into "problems" and make them a clickable links
  - here is the link from slides [link](https://github.com/mike-works/vscode-fundamentals/blob/master/docs/2_customizing/tasks.md)
    - an example where this could be useful is if you run prettier and try to lint the code and to make as clickable links all the warnings and errors


## Markdown
- [slides](https://github.com/mike-works/vscode-fundamentals/blob/master/docs/1_using/markdown.md)
- you can use img tags (like in html) and give them a lot of options
  `<img src="vscode_icon.png" height=50 align=right vspace=20 />`
- align attribute can be used on variety of HTML tags
- `<p align=right>hello</p>`
