Functional Programming

  - Functions as First-Class Objects
    - functions as variables/constants
    - unless you want to use "this" state, always use arrow functions
  - Pure Functions (Without Side Effects)
    - Since this is not really possible, the goal is to separate what can be pure from impure code (which produces side-effects, e.g., database management)
  - High-Order Functions (HOF)
    - take other functions as parameters
    - can either return new function or some other result based on the function passed as input
    - e.g., map, filter, reduce
    - e.g., measuring time
    - check HOF that Lodash provides
      - check .memoize for memoization (caching of results of expensive calculations)
      - try example yourself[https://levelup.gitconnected.com/understanding-functional-programming-in-javascript-a-complete-guide-e85ed13b42c8](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/understanding-functional-programming-in-javascript-a-complete-guide-e85ed13b42c8) [search in the text for memoization]
  - Work Declaratively (and this way avoid loops)
    - reduce, map, forEach, filter, find, every, some
  - Function Composition
    - Ideally, functions should be small. They should be doing only one thing and they should do it well.
    - Function Composition - making the result of one function be the parameter of the next one
    - Lodash provides pipeline function
      - _.flow() or fp.pipeline ([link](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide))
    - Composing is alternative to pipeline
      - order of parameters is inverted (right to left, last function in pipeline is here the first one)
    - For both Pipeline and Composing it is required that these functions are to be unary (one argument) by default.
      - Currying is a simple way to transform non-unary functions to work in unary form
        - Lodash has a method for this, but still it is slightly confusing
        - Currying is useful when params come in order
      - Alternative to currying is Partial Application
        - it does not need to have unary parameter
