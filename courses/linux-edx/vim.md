`echo "some text" > some_file` (will print "some text" to some_file, and overwrite existing content if it exists)
`echo "additional text" >> some_file` (will append "some text" to some_file)
# Text Editors
## Vim
`vim -r myfile` (edit in a recovery mode from a system crash)

vim has three modes: Command, Insert, and Line.

Typing `: sh` or maybe `: sh command` opens an external command shell. When you exit the shell, you will resume your vi editing session.

Typing `:!` executes a command from within vi. The command follows the exclamation point. This technique is best suited for non-interactive commands, such as : `! wc %`. Typing this will run the wc (word count) command on the file; the character **%** represents the file currently being edited.

in vim check:
1. what is leader key
2. plugins and dotfiles
3. vim macros
4. marks (works like bookmarks)
5. `:earlier` will give you the erlier version of the same file

# 3. VIM
Missing Semester [lecture notes](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/)

Complex key combinations are usually labeled in docs in 3 exchangable ways
1. `^V`
2. `Ctrl-V`
3. `<C-V>`
- they all mean the same "CTRL + V"

## Split Panes and Buffers
[vim splits move faster and more naturally](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/vim-splits-move-faster-and-more-naturally)
- in VIM "open files" are called "open buffers"
- VIM has tabs and windowses (like in tile managers)

- `0` goes to the beginning of the line
- `^` goes to first not empty char on the line (not space char)

similar to k and l, use `^U` and `^D` to go up and down (but 10 lines up or down)

## Visual Mode
`Shift-V` (‚ùì) puts you in Visual-Line mode (selects the whole line for you) which you can then copy or do whatever you want
- y - to copy/yank

`~` (tilda) changes the case of selected characters
