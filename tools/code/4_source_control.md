# Git
## inline annotations to show differences from your local changes
- each new line which is changed, i.e., different from content commited in Repository will be marked with "some blue marker" next to the line number
- if the content is removed we see in a similar way the red triangle which denotes that something is removed
- if the content is added it will show green indicator
- the indicator in the bottom-bar next to the branch name is the sync-indicator (it does both pull and push, and that is the main difference to "just pull")
- in vscode is really simple to undo last commit
- in Source Control window just find option "undo last commit"

- similar like in SourceTree, you can also stage only chunks of a certain file
  - in GIT view select part of the file which you want to stage and right-click it
    - select "stage selected ranges" (there are options to revert and untrack)

Github has an official extension for working with Pull Requests in VS Code
