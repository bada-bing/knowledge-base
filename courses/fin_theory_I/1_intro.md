MIT 15.401 - The Professor: Andrew Lo [MIT Sloan School of Management]
# Motivation
Mathematics + $$$ = Finance
Finance is a systematic discipline of study of financial transactions (of money)
- some relevant people which are mentioned:
	1. ... James Simons - guy who founded Reneiscancse Technologies (He was math professor)
	- probably the most successful hedge fund in terms of its performance record (the domain is called quantitative investment strategies
	2. Warren Buffet (at that time the richest person in the world)
	3. Jack Welch (The Ceo of General Electric; Neutron Jack; increase 4.5 times the revenue of GE from 26bn$ to 130bn$ per year)

The main focus of this lecture will be on (some of the pillars of the economy):
1. Financial Intermediaries
2. Capital Markets
3. Households
4. Nonfinancial Corporations

# Fundamental Challenges of Finance
- All Business Activities Reduce to 2 Functions
	- Valuation of Assets (real/financial, tangible/intangible)
		- valuation (figuring the value) can be challenging part
	- Management of Assets (acquiring/selling)
		- basically management can be summarized as figuring out which of 2 options is more valuable (I suppose 2 options are buy or do nothing, and sell or do nothing)
		- management involves making decision
- Business Decisions involve Valuation and Management
	- can't value what you can't measure

Objectives + Valuations => Decisions

- Valuation is generally independent from objectives
- The Finance helps us to determine the value (and make decision) through "price discovery" process
	- he gives an extremely amusing example of price discovery with limited information (the students bid for the small package; and the guy gave 45$ and got actually the ipad nano (worth 150$))
- he showed how the lack of transperency(info about the product) reduced its value

2 Fundamental Challenges of Finance apply to both Personal and Cororate Finance Decisions

# The Framework of Financial Analysis
- Accounting (the lng of fin)
- stock (not equities (ie, common stock)) vs "flow" variables
	- by stock here is meant the stock/level of assets
	- by flow is meant the rate of change of assets
		- the flow is derivative of the stock (the good analogy would be if we have a bathtub)
			- the amount of water is stock; the flow would be how fast new water from faccet is coming into the baththub

- Balance Sheet and Income Stmt Perspectives
- Balance Sheet - snapshot of financial status quo (stock)
- Income Stmt - rate of change of the status quo (flow)
- Financial Status <=> Balance Sheet
- Financial Decisions <=> Income Stmt 
	- how much is company making per unit of time (income stmt is typically considered on quarterly basis)

- Corporate Financial Decisions (check the diagram; i took the screenshot)
- As a financial manager you are focused on the flow of cash
1. Cash raised from investors (selling financial assets)
2. Cash invested in real assets (tangible and intangible)
3. Cash generated by operations
4. Cash reinvested
5. Cash returned to investors (debt payments, dividends, etc.)

The goal of the finance chief officer (or more or less of the whole company) is to increase the value of shareholders

Assets - something that provides future benefits to the business
Liability - Something you are obligated to pay in near future (it is something you need to pay because you received something)

# 2 other Factors that made Fin Analysis chalenging
1. Time
- The cashflows now are diff from cashflows later
- how should we model temporal differencies
2. Risk
- risk creates significant challenges
- how to model unkknown?

To address these challenges:
1. use historical data
2. use math (probability and statistics)
- challenges can easily overwhelm current math abilities

6 Fundamental Principles of Finance (check screenshot)
1. There is no such a thing as a free lunch ("no easy way", ie, there are no systematic free lunches)
